# About Us

We are Open Mfantse Community, a volunteer group of Mfantse speaking individuals, 
with the single aim of documenting everything and anything about Mfantsefo.

## The Ajumako Project

The project was started by Enoch T. Enchill as an open source project and he named it ** The Ajumako Project **
