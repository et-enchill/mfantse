# Open Mfantse Community


**Mfantse** (/m'fan'tse/), also known as Fantse or Fante, is one of the three principal members of the Akan dialect continuum, 
along with Asante and Akuapem, the latter two collectively known as Twi, with which it is mutually intelligible.
It is principally spoken in the central and southern regions of Ghana as well as in settlements in other regions in western Ghana, 
Ivory Coast, as well as in Liberia, Gambia and Angola.
